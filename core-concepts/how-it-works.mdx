title: How it Works
description: "Understand the core evaluation process of SigmaEval, from defining success and simulating user interactions to judging and analyzing the results."

At its core, SigmaEval uses two AI agents to automate evaluation: an **AI User Simulator** that realistically tests your application, and an **AI Judge** that scores its performance. The process is as follows:

1.  **Define "Good"**: You start by defining a test scenario in plain language, including the user's goal and a clear description of the successful outcome you expect. This becomes your objective quality bar.

2.  **Simulate and Collect Data**: The **AI User Simulator** acts as a test user, interacting with your application based on your scenario. It runs these interactions many times to collect a robust dataset of conversations.

3.  **Judge and Analyze**: The **AI Judge** scores each conversation against your definition of success. SigmaEval then applies statistical methods to these scores to determine if your quality bar has been met with a specified level of confidence.
